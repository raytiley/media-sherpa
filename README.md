============

A service to upload media to different online services (currently only archive.org).

Right now the docs aren't that good. I'm sorry. If someone emails me and tells me to write some documentation I'll do it.
Basically to install do the following:

*Download the installer fromt he releases
*Double click to install it
*Find config file in the install directory and edit it to use your Archive / Cablecast Credentials
*Create an Archive-Upload and Archive-URL custom fields in Cablecast.


Once the above is done you can put an 'X' in the 'Archive-Upload' field and it will upload your originals to archive.org!

If you have issues or feature requests please add them to the issue tracker. The more people that want to use this the more motivated I'll be to make it more awesome.
